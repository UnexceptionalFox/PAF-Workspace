Until import tools are released:

If there is a folder labeled 0, Import that fbx first!!!
For each model, import the FBX in Folder 1, then Import the FBX in folder 2 on top of it.

For alternate versions of the same pal do not import the skeleton, use the same base skeleton on import for deafult use cases.

If making a custom skeleton, the skeleton should not matter as the mesh will replace the base mesh in the game and reference your imported Skeleton.
